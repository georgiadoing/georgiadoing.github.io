My current project integrates methods to process compendia of microbial RNA-seq data ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.24.477642v1)) that I worked on during my phd with Deb Hogan, and the project of Michelle Spoto, a recently graduated phd dmd student from Julia Oh's lab that integrated genome-wide CRISPRi knock-down screens and RNA-seq of *S. epidermidis* ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.442003v2)). Using multi-omic, computational and experimental, functional screening approaches, I am exploring the consequences of strain diversity in microbes, microbiomes and microbial interactions.
