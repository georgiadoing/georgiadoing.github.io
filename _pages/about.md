Current projects stem from methods to process compendia of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* gene expression data ([Doing et al 2023 ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36541761/)) that I worked on during my PhD with Deborah Hogan, and the work from my postdoc in Julia Oh's lab that integrated genomic nad transcriptomics data of *S. epidermidis* and *Staphylococcus aureus*([Doing et al 2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40261045/)). Using multi-omic, computational and experimental, functional screening approaches, I am exploring the consequences of strain diversity in microbes, microbiomes and microbial interactions by gleaning functions for previously uncharacterized genes.
